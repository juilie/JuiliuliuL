    <p>
        I don't listen to "historical" music much, but my dear friend <a
            href="https://soundcloud.com/tobias-haus">Tobias Haus</a> sent me
        a video of a duet (Harpsichord and Theorbo) playing <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzoFKG7ITRg&ab_channel=WarnerClassics">"Les Baricades
            Mïstérieuses"</a>
        (The Mysterious Barricades) by François Couperin. (Check out the <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzoFKG7ITRg&ab_channel=WarnerClassics">video</a> it's
        great)<br><br>
        Sometimes historical performance just hits deep (҂◡_◡)<br><br>
        Toby and I will be performing it for friends this Friday - I'll try to tape and post here. The song
        is typically a solo piece, but
        Jean Rondeau & Thomas Dunford arranged/embellished it so the theorbo is playing some nice
        harmonies<br><br>
        Since I think this is their original take, I couldn't find music - so I transcribed the theorbo part
        for guitar. I believe all of the notes are correct. I took some...liberties with the rhythmic
        notation.
        If you play along with the video I think it will be clear what's going on<br><br>
        So here it is: A guitar transcription of Thomas Dunford's theorbo part of "Les Baricades
        Mïstérieuses" by Couperin.<br>
