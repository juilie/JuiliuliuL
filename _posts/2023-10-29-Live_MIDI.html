<p>
    I started working on live MIDI visualizations. At first inspired by old General MIDI visualizing software that takes in a .mid file and shows some old cgi band playing the song,
    but later inspired by a new Pobbles release. The first Pobbles video, seems to me like it must have used MIDI to create Pobbles, and finally shaders had a broader appeal to me.
    For a while I found it hard to sync up my visualizer, and I felt like shaders could sometimes be a very cool addition to a performance, but didn't really feel connected to the music.<br>
    MIDI fixes that!<br>
    I did a performance using my first MIDI visualizers, and the hope is a) get my visualizers to a point where they're super cool but an afterthought to my performances b) work with artists to 
    add live midi visuals to their shows c) make music videos<br>
    Making a general Midi visualizer would be great for the PCoTandy GM competition - I probably wouldn't make unique visuals for every instrument, but maybe for categories. Eventually every one could be sweet!

            Make a switch statement to filter each MIDI channel to different functions
        </li>
        <li>
            Do whatever you want for each channel, possibly use velocity and note values
