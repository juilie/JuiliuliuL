<h1>Live MIDI</h1>
<p>

    <!-- I'm going to the Recurse Center. I've played 2 shows in a week that I ended up staying up til 4 because of.
    There's weird quality to perceived convenience/difficult of a tool. It took me less than a minute to understand to add to this blog, even though the process 
    is really low tech an clunky. All in all it is a small inconvenience.<br> It took very little time to understand and I have <span style="letter-spacing: 3px; padding: 0 5px;">complete control</span> over styling 
    because it's all html.<br> -->
    I started working on live MIDI visualizations. At first inspired by old General MIDI visualizing software that takes in a .mid file and shows some old cgi band playing the song,
    but later inspired by a new Pobbles release. The first Pobbles video, seems to me like it must have used MIDI to create Pobbles, and finally shaders had a broader appeal to me.
    For a while I found it hard to sync up my visualizer, and I felt like shaders could sometimes be a very cool addition to a performance, but didn't really feel connected to the music.<br>
    MIDI fixes that!<br>
    I did a performance using my first MIDI visualizers, and the hope is a) get my visualizers to a point where they're super cool but an afterthought to my performances b) work with artists to 
    add live midi visuals to their shows c) make music videos<br>
    Making a general Midi visualizer would be great for the PCoTandy GM competition - I probably wouldn't make unique visuals for every instrument, but maybe for categories. Eventually every one could be sweet!

            Make a switch statement to filter each MIDI channel to different functions

        <li>
            Do whatever you want for each channel, possibly use velocity and note values
