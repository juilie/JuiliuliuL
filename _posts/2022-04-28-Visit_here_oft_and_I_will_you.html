<h1>Visit here oft and I will you</h1>
<p>Wow! I started this page today and now it's 3am.<br><br> This Pode (PodeCentral blogipode) will be
    updated...semiregularly.....hopefully.
    If you're reading this, drop your blog in the livechat and I will follow yours. You should update
    regularly too. I want to try this to just see if <i>maybe</i>
    it's better or supplemental to social media. what would it be like if a critical mass of my irl
    friends had blogs like this pode right here??<br><br>
    Anyway here's some little snippets of stuff on my mind and life:<br>
    <ul style="line-height:30px;">

    There's bad stuff too - I don't know how I will or won't share the sad and bad things - a
    shadowpode? we'll see.
    For now, refer to the right column to understand the content of each pode before reading Goodnight â™¥
