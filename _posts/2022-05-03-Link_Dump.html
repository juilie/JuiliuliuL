<h1>Link Dump: Indie web and more :)</h1>
<p>
    Today a community in my periphery came into clearer sight for me. The IndieWeb is a term used for
    multiple things, sometimes for the <a href="https://yesterweb.org/">Yesterweb</a> - but it turns out
    there is
    a consolidated community called the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>. They seem more
    aligned as technologists
    whereas the Yesterweb is focused on early web aesthetics and teaching non-programmers how to make
    websites. It's like web3 but for and by the people!
    I still have more to say, but I'm trying to keep these short for now - I'm excited by both
    communities and their interplay :) <br><br>

            on all platforms but link back to your website...according to the talk above

            I burn for the heavenly connection. I like how this talks about twitter as a town square.
            Bring back town squares!
