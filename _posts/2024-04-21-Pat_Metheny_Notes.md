I was recently re-reading my good friend's [blog](https://suneinyneeenan.github.io/Blog/) and was inspired by the way they post/share unedited notes. I took some notes from a Pat Metheny show I saw last week (it was awesome) - he said he doesn't normally talk so I jotted down something about most of what he said. I don't know how helpful any of it is, the most tangible thing in there are some of the baritone guitar notes/tunings

<h2>Pat Metheny Notes</h2>

Four and more
Seven steps to heaven

There weren’t that many guitar players in Kansas City, so he got to start working

Jimmy smith trio

Trumpet everybody thinks same thing with
Trumpet

But guitar has no single definition
Everybody thinks something different
Emphasis when he said Segovia lol
There’s something important about that
Also Chet atkins was one of the examples

He’s playing a nylon baritone Martin looking thing

He joined Gary burton

He met Charlie Haden, big hero, from Keith jarrett quartet

Invited Charlie to play on 8081
Became super tight with Charlie, was best man at Charlie’s wedding

Played with a ton of people together 

Charlie mentioned they could do a duet record sometime , they were friends but Charlie was still an idol

Charlie said to bring acoustic guitars 
Charlie duet album is cult hit

People had that record and didn’t have either of pat or Charlie’s other records


Ending a song with thumb strum but don’t get quiet

Common studio technique, baritone guitar with pick doubling the bass

Tune middle 2 strings of baritone guitar up an octave (neighbor said only way it works?)

One quiet night was from 6hours of middle two string octave play

Hit the flat 9 by mistake, held it !

The baritone tuning he thinks of three two stringed instruments, viola violin cello 

Pat did whole new album on nylon baritone with the octave tuning coming out in a few weeks

Played autumn leaves

Now he’s olaying another tune with the same process, plays the bass line on a loop pedal, then jams over it. Could be show shtick, but seems like a cool practice, the autumn leaves bass loop was really long, a lot to remember and then it’s super cool when it locks in with the guitar
