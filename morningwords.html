            A venerating thread looped through all that I knew<br>
            But today the stitches are loose and lossy<br>
            Such a venerated thread you would think is working<br>
            But time tells what time always has known

        You were breathless<br>
        And then you were there breathless<br>
        And I was breathless<br>
        Searching for breath<br>
        In my heart I found you<br>
        Floating breathless<br>
        Aching for breath<br>

        Morning words to make. <br>
        I write them every day.<br>
        To make more words and practice the words I know and say.<br>
        So this morning I write some words.<br>
        And tomorrow write them more today.<br>
