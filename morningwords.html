        Breaaak I'm on break<br>
        It's bad tho<br>
        Don't worry it's nothing<br>
        But it's pretty bad<br>
        But there's nothing to worry about<br>
        It's just bad<br>
        But everyone's ok<br>
        But it's really messed up tho<br>
        But it's all fine<br>

            I don't really want to write today<br>
            But I am anyway to keep a habit<br>
            It's probably the family trauma<br>
            That never stops changing and adapting<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I could easily spend this morning wondering<br>
            Why don't I want to write? Is it boring now?<br>
            And I'd be denying myself the space to acknowledge<br>
            The supremely obvious explanation<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            My mind wandered this morning<br>
            If I should tell my dad that we know everything he did<br>
            And that I still want to forgive him<br>
            And I let my brain simulate what would happen<br>
            And he beat me to death<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            So when I wonder why I don't want to write<br>
            I should remember there's no need to wonder<br>
            I'm doing a disservice to myself<br>
            To think it's anything but obvious<br>

        Skipping a class feels so good<br>
        it's like one of the best feelings<br>
        It's better than if you didn't even have class<br>
        such a sweet release damn<br>
        Too bad I'm not a student anymore<br>

            A venerating thread looped through all that I knew<br>
            But today the stitches are loose and lossy<br>
            Such a venerated thread you would think is working<br>
            But time tells what time always has known

        You were breathless<br>
        And then you were there breathless<br>
        And I was breathless<br>
        Searching for breath<br>
        In my heart I found you<br>
        Floating breathless<br>
        Aching for breath<br>

        Morning words to make. <br>
        I write them every day.<br>
        To make more words and practice the words I know and say.<br>
        So this morning I write some words.<br>
        And tomorrow write them more today.<br>
