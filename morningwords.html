            You were breathless<br>
            And then you were there breathless<br>
            And I was breathless<br>
            Searching for breath<br>
            In my heart I found you<br>
            Floating breathless<br>
            Aching for breath<br>

            Morning words to make. <br>
            I write them every day.<br>
            To make more words and practice the words I know and say.<br>
            So this morning I write some words.<br>
            And tomorrow write them more today.<br>
        </p>
